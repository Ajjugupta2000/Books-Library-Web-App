# Getting Started with Create React App
## About
A Books library app using the Open Library Subjects and Search APIs can be a powerful tool for book enthusiasts, librarians, and anyone who wants to easily find and organize books based on different topics or subjects. Open Library is an open-source platform that provides access to a vast collection of books and information about them. The Open Library Subjects and Search APIs allow developers to access this information and integrate it into their own applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
